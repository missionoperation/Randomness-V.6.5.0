# Eaglercraft Site #

# ATTENTION MOJANG #
## this site was coded with HTML5 but none of the contents inside was made by ME. All the clients/games of eaglercraft were found on github made by OTHER people. For this please do not DMCA this project as I wish to give people the expierence to play all eaglercraft versions and clients. I repeat I did not make any of these eaglercraft clients/games I only inputted the links of them from OTHER people on github. ##

## What its about ##
### This site is used with no proxies or chats included, just simple Eaglercraft clients/games that people can enjoy playing around with! This is not used in any way to try to encourage anything bad but instead to encourage something fun which people will play the games for. ###

## Why Did I do this ##
### I first made this site on a google site. As it was working well I kept hitting through barriers the made the gameplay more tiring and the fullscreen mode mandatory. With coding it in I can actually resolve most of these bugs to keep the site in one a better style with CSS and two it the bugs have been fixed! ###

## How to open it up as a file ##
### Click the green button saying code and click download Zip. Once you do that it will send you a  zip file. Open the zip file and it will open to a folder of the Site. In that folder there is a file called index.html open that up and it should open into a tab. Once that is done you can delete the zip file.  ###

## Eaglercraft Mobile ##
### For those who are wondering, this site is able to be played on a mobile phone/ipad and computer. ###
